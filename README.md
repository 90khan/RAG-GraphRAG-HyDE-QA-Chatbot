# 📚 RAG + GraphRAG + HyDE QA Chatbot

This project is a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** based **Question-Answering Chatbot** with a **Streamlit** interface, now enhanced with **GraphRAG** and **HyDE (Hypothetical Document Embeddings)**.  
Users can upload **PDF** or **DOCX** files; the app extracts text, stores embeddings in **FAISS**, builds a knowledge graph, and generates **context-aware answers** using a **Hugging Face** model augmented with HyDE.

## ✨ Features

* 📂 **File Upload:** Upload multiple PDF/DOCX documents  
* 🧩 **Text Processing:** Cleaning + chunking  
* 🔎 **Search Engine:** FAISS + optional BM25 hybrid retrieval  
* 🤖 **RAG Pipeline:** Hugging Face *Flan-T5* for context-aware answers  
* 🧠 **GraphRAG Pipeline:** Knowledge graph construction and reasoning from uploaded documents  
* 💭 **HyDE Support:** Generates hypothetical documents to improve answers in low-data scenarios  
* 🔁 **Cache:** Disk-based caching (`shelve`) for faster repeated queries  
* 🏷️ **Metadata:** Responses include document names for traceability  
* 🔑 **Authentication:** Simple username/password login via environment variables  
* 🐳 **Dockerized:** Easy to build and deploy

## 🧠 Tech Stack

* Python 3.10+
* Streamlit
* FAISS
* Hugging Face Transformers
* spaCy (entity extraction)
* NetworkX (graph building & querying)
* Docker / Docker Compose

---

## 🧪 Example Usage

1. Upload one or more `.pdf` or `.docx` files.
2. Ask a question about the content (e.g., *"Summarize the introduction section"*).
3. The chatbot retrieves relevant context:

   * **RAG:** via vector embeddings (FAISS + optional BM25)
   * **GraphRAG:** leverages related entities for complex reasoning
   * **HyDE:** generates hypothetical documents to fill gaps when explicit answers are missing
4. The app produces context-aware answers using Hugging Face *Flan-T5*.

---

## 🧠 GraphRAG Usage

* Enable **Knowledge Graph** in the sidebar.
* Click **Build Knowledge Graph** to extract entities and relations from uploaded documents.
* GraphRAG improves retrieval for multi-step reasoning and complex queries.

---

## 💡 HyDE Usage

* Integrated into the RAG pipeline.
* Generates hypothetical documents based on the query to improve answer quality.
* Especially useful for low-data or incomplete document scenarios, providing a seamless contextual response.
